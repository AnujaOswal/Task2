1.In script.js File-

//creating request instance
var req= new XMLHttpRequest();

//initate a connection or create connection
req.open('GET','https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all',true);

//sending request
req.send();

//load function
//this fun will be triggered only when the data has been recived successfully.
req.onload=function(){
var data=JSON.parse(this.response); //current created object data
data.forEach(c => {
    (console.log(c.name))
});
    


}

2.Difference Between Call by Value and Call by Reference is-
i)Call by Value: 
Suppose there is a variable named “a”. Now, we store a primitive value(boolean, integer, float, etc) in the variable “a”.

Let us store an integer value in “a”, Let a=5. Now the variable “a” stores 5 and has an address location where that primitive value sits in memory.

Now, suppose we copy the value of “a” in “b” by assignment (a=b). Now, “b” points to a new location in memory, containing the same data as variable “a”.

Thus, a=b=5 but both points to separate locations in memory.

This approach is called call by value where 2 variables become the same by copying the value but in 2 separate spots in the memory.
-------------------------------------------------------------
a)It copies the value of a variable passed in a function to a local variable.
b)Both these variables occupy separate locations in memory. Thus, if changes are made in a particular variable it does not affect the other one.

ii)Call by reference:
 Let’s say, we have an object stored in the variable “a”. The variable stores the location or the address where the object lives.

 Now we set b=a. Now that new variable “b” instead of pointing to a new location in the memory, points to the same location where “a” does.

 No new object is created, no copy is created. Both the variables point to the same object. This is like having 2 names.
This is call by reference. It behaves quite differently from by value. All objects interact by reference.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
a)all objects interact by reference.
b)If an object is stored in a variable and that variable is made equal to another variable then both of them occupy the same location in memory.
c)Changes in one object variable affect the other object variable.


3.Copy by value a composite type can be achieved with the help of -
i)Use the spread (...) syntax
ii)Use the Object.assign() method
iii)Use the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
